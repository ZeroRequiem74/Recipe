# Overview

This app is a recipe saver app. It allows the user to save a recipe, name and a list of ingredients, and then when you go to the recipe list it allows you to search through the recipes, either by name or by ingredient.

I made this because I wanted something useful for an app, and I know that I have been frustrated more than once because I couldn't find a certain recipe that I took a photo of in my phone.

# Development Environment

I used flutter and dart for this program. I chose this because it is compatible with both android and ios devices but I have a windows computer and as such could not easily make an ios app.

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

* I want to make it so that it saves the recipes locally, I tried but was unable to do so in the end.
* I want to add a description section so that I can detail the steps in making the dish.
* I want to make it so that when you select a recipe it will go to another page that shows the ingredients and description.
